You need libtool and whatnot, but usually all the required tools are already
installed.

As for the libraries, seom-player requires the XVideo/XShm extensions, which
I hope you have installed.

Installing seom is then as easy as executing './configure', 'make' and then
'make install' as root.


./configure options
===================

So far, only --prefix=?? is supported.


compiling 32bit seom under 64bit userspace
==========================================

$ setarch i686 ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make CC="gcc 32" LIBDIR=lib32
