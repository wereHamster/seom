You need libtool and whatnot, but usually all the required tools are already
installed.

As for the libraries, seom-player requires the XVideo/XShm extensions, which
I hope you have installed.

Installing seom is then as easy as executing './configure', 'make' and then
'make install' as root.


./configure options
===================

When executing ./configure, set PREFIX, ARCH or LIBDIR environment variables
to override the default values.

$ PREFIX=/usr ARCH=amd64 ./configure


compiling 32bit seom under 64bit userspace
==========================================

Override CC and LIBDIR and you should be fine:

$ make CC="gcc 32" LIBDIR=lib32


platform specific optimizations
===============================

Use ARCH=??? to specify your platform, the default is C (no optimization,
plain C functions), also available are 'x86' and 'amd64'. The optimized
functions are roughly twice as fast as their C counterparts so it's strongly
advised that you use them. Example:

$ ARCH=x86 LIBDIR=lib32 ./configure
$ make CC="gcc -m32"
